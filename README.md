# pyweek26


This game is written for pyweek 26

I just tested it in python 3 and on Windows :)

## how to play

You can simply run compiano.py to run my game

I should first tell you that you can press the ESC key to exit :)

press the Enter key to start the game, there should be blocks raising up, each block would have its own letter on it, say 'f','g','h','j' or 'k', when the block reach the line above, press the corresponding key.
